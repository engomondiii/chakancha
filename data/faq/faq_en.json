      "question": "What is tea and where does it come from?",
      "answer": "Tea comes from the Camellia Sinensis plant, a shrub cultivated from antiquity in China and now grown in countries like Japan, India, Kenya, and Ethiopia. The plant has lanceolate leaves and fragrant white flowers. Both black and green tea are derived from this same plant.",

      "category": "tea_processing",
      "question": "What is the difference between black tea and green tea?",
      "answer": "The difference between black and green tea comes from how the plant is processed, not from different plants. Black tea goes through withering, rolling, oxidation, and firing. Green tea skips the oxidation process - the leaves are withered, then pan-fired to prevent oxidation, rolled, and dried. This is why green tea leaves remain green while black tea leaves turn dark.",

      "category": "tea_processing",
      "question": "How is black tea processed?",
      "answer": "Black tea processing involves four main stages: 1) Withering - leaves are spread to dry and reduce water content for about a day until pliable. 2) Rolling - leaves are twisted to break cells and release aromatic oils. 3) Oxidation - leaves absorb oxygen and turn bright copper color for several hours. 4) Firing - leaves are moved through hot air chambers to stop fermentation, turning dark and losing moisture to about 2%.",

      "question": "How is green tea processed?",
      "answer": "Green tea processing is the shortest. The steps are: 1) Withering (sometimes omitted). 2) Pan firing or firing to prevent oxidation from occurring. 3) Rolling the leaves. 4) Final drying for its final shape. The key difference is that green tea skips the rolling and oxidation stages, which is why the leaves remain green.",

The extent of oxidation determines whether you get black, green, or oolong tea.",

      "question": "Why is hand-picking important for tea quality?",
      "answer": "Hand-picking ensures the highest quality tea because skilled pickers select only the best leaves and buds at the right stage of development. This selective harvesting maintains consistent quality and prevents damage to the tea plant, unlike mechanical harvesting which can include stems and lower-quality leaves.",
